# Cassandra Metrics RHQ Server Plugin

This is an [RHQ](http://www.jboss.org/rhq) server plugin that uses [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org)
for persisting and managing metric data. This plugin is part of a prototyping effort to
evaluate different solutions as a next-generate data store for metrics, event logging, and
other data performance and scalability demands that cannot always be handled by a 
traditional RDBMS.
